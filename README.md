Xcode plugin for showing all issue content in the issue navigator. No more ellipsis!

![](screenshot.png)

Consider this an early prototype, it works, but the implementation is hacky and calculates larger heights for the issue navigator cells than necessary.

## Installation

Either

- Clone and build the plugin yourself, it will be installed to the right location automatically by building it.

or

- Install it via [Alcatraz](http://alcatraz.io/)

In any case, relaunch Xcode to load it.
